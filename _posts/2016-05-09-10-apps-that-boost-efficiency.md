It's 2016, and it's so much easier to stay connected.  The apps (and some Google Chrome extensions that go with them) below, all of them free, are 10 of my favorite ones I highly recommend you use to stay connected with people, to be in the loop with the world (through information), and to link your devices and services together.

----------

## 1: Connect, automate, and boost efficiency with IF by IFTTT

	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123733/aabb71f4-15ea-11e6-8073-b56291ce5c30.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123733/aabb71f4-15ea-11e6-8073-b56291ce5c30.png"></a>
</figure>

IFTTT stands for IF-This-Then-That.  With IF, provided by IFTTT, you add channels (i.e. connect to apps) and create an if-then recipe, tying two apps together to perform an action when a certain condition is triggered.  In the image, I added a recipe where if I add a post to my WordPress blog, it will automatically tweet the post (you can, of course, edit your tweet).  There's a lot of cool recipes to check out, and there are so many recipes that really boost efficiency or makes things automated.

I plan to write a post about how to use IF and some recipes I highly recommend!

## 2: Access your files anywhere and everywhere with Dropbox

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123728/aaafc1a6-15ea-11e6-80e9-12111576eb4b.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123728/aaafc1a6-15ea-11e6-80e9-12111576eb4b.png"></a>
</figure>

Seriously, having Dropbox will change your life.  This cloud service is available in most platforms, so you can literally access your files anywhere.  You can also share public folders with anyone, so there's a collaboration aspect to it as well.  The best use of Dropbox for me is to have my Keepass file accessible to and updated from any device.

I will write about how to easily connect Dropbox with Keepass to have access to all your passwords from any device in another post!

## 3: Store all passwords and retrieve them with Keepass

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123730/aab59cf2-15ea-11e6-8823-cc81e55062c5.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123730/aab59cf2-15ea-11e6-8823-cc81e55062c5.png"></a>
</figure>

When you have too many subscriptions and passwords to keep up with like I do, Keepass is a lifesaver.  You can store user names, passwords, URL's and notes, and you can do other cool things like generate passwords.  With the Google Chrome extension, you can look up the password for your current tab very quickly with the click of a button (and typing your master password, if password is not set to remember).  Just never, ever forget your master password, and set a really strong one!

## 4: Save and access your favorite articles and more with Pocket

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123734/aac3f6e4-15ea-11e6-8948-ac4f118ce6a2.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123734/aac3f6e4-15ea-11e6-8948-ac4f118ce6a2.png"></a>
</figure>

Pocket is the best way to save all your favorite articles, images, and videos into one place.  You can add tags, favorite, and archive things, so organization is super easy.  Using IFTTT or the Google Chrome extension, saving the things you like is literally a click of a button!  Saving recipes and reading them on my iPad really makes my cooking sessions easier and enjoyable (bigger screens are better in those cases!).

## 5: Gather all kinds of information with Feedly

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123732/aaba099a-15ea-11e6-91de-8b869a10a403.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123732/aaba099a-15ea-11e6-91de-8b869a10a403.png"></a>
</figure>

Feedly is my absolute favorite news feed.  You can add a LOT of blogs news sites from numerous categories and read them from any device, all from just one app that's easy to navigate through.  You can also save your favorite articles for later.  I keep myself informed everyday through Feedly, also checking daily deals around the web.  I recommend blogs and news sites like Business Insider, CNN, and Lifehacker.

## 6: Keep your eyes on the road with Waze

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123736/aacb7d1a-15ea-11e6-8f3d-dce8736dca19.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123736/aacb7d1a-15ea-11e6-8f3d-dce8736dca19.png"></a>
</figure>

Waze is like Google Maps fused with social media.  It's a solid navigation system like Google Maps that will redirect you to the fastest route and estimate arrival times accurately, but the social media aspect of it really makes things both fun and helpful.  Basically, Wazers will report traffic / construction / police sightings / debris on road / vehicle stopped / etc., so you can be prepared ahead of time.  You can also coordinate with your friends and family when traveling to the same place by telling them where you currently are or when you'll arrive to that destination.  The avatars are adorable as well!

## 7: Keep track of your finances with Mint

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123731/aab6a7fa-15ea-11e6-832f-04946f691920.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123731/aab6a7fa-15ea-11e6-832f-04946f691920.png"></a>
</figure>

For those of you like me who can never keep track of finances very well, Mint is a blessing.  You can tie cards and bank accounts to your Mint, and it will create charts and infographics of your remaining balance, spending, etc.  You can also set reminders for payment and loans as well.  It's so much more efficient when you have everything in one place!

## 8: Send and receive money easily with Venmo

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123737/aacc7814-15ea-11e6-8d18-1df38b599aab.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123737/aacc7814-15ea-11e6-8d18-1df38b599aab.png"></a>
</figure>

Venmo is a service where you can easily (and I mean super easily) pay or request payment from people.  Transactions are through your bank account or through Venmo credit, which is the money you receive from others (you can transfer Venmo credit back to your bank account, free of charge).  You don't have to publicize the transactions of course, but that's an option as well.

## 9: Never miss a conversation with (Facebook) Messenger

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123729/aab43a88-15ea-11e6-9579-6733db2b9473.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123729/aab43a88-15ea-11e6-9579-6733db2b9473.png"></a>
</figure>

Most people have Facebook.  Even if you don't have one, however (but seriously, you should!), you can still use Messenger by registering your phone number and name.  Messenger is really one of the quickest ways to talk to people, and it also includes services like voice and video calling, sending photos and videos, group chatting, and abusing using adorable stickers and GIFs.

## 10: Keep in touch with everyone with Skype

<figure>
	<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123735/aac65952-15ea-11e6-9bc2-cb1ed30ddf84.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8562283/15123735/aac65952-15ea-11e6-9bc2-cb1ed30ddf84.png"></a>
</figure>

Skype is an amazing tool for video calls, file sharing, group calls, and more.  It's a service a lot of people use, and even interviewers use Skype screening in replacement of phone screenings at times.  My absolute favorite feature of Skype is the screen sharing function, which proved to be useful when explaining what's happening on your own screen.  You can use Skype on any device, so having it on every device you own is a smart thing to do.

### BONUS: Always be in the loop with social media

Social media is pretty much one of the best ways to stay connected with people you know and with strangers.  Most services are primarily used for entertainment purposes, but they can really be useful when you're gathering information or when there's a crisis (e.g. Facebook's Safety Check, Twitter's tags during crises).  Some common and useful social media apps include:

* Facebook
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Instagram
* Snapchat
* Reddit
* Pinterest
* WhatsApp
* Vine
* LinkedIn

All these apps makes life easier, so definitely try them out if you haven't.  Do you have an app that's invaluable to you?  Promote it and boast about its usefulness here!

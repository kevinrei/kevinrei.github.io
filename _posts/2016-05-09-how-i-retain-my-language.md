I haven't really studied Japanese since I left Japan when I was 10 years old.  However, I still "study" it pretty much everyday (minus the writing portion, but I can type!).  How I do it is by being immersed in the culture and products that are released from Japan.

You probably heard suggestions of watching shows or tune into the radio in the language you're studying, and that's basically the "self-study" method I used.  It's a great way to retain and improve on a language you've learned over time, but it's hard for me to recommend it as a study tool (especially if you want to learn the language quickly and efficiently).

## Books (in my case, manga and novels)

I used to read this comic book called <a href="http://www.corocoro.tv/" target="_blank">月刊コロコロコミック</a> (Monthly Coro Coro Comic) all the time back in Japan.  It has some complicated Kanji, but it always has *Furigana* (reading aid) so I can learn the word and ask for or look up the meaning of the word.  Even when I moved to the Philippines, I kept up with my Japanese through these comic books.  I also read the <a href="http://aoitori.kodansha.co.jp/series/password/" target="_blank">Password</a> series, which  I highly recommend to those studying Japanese.  Words I didn't know, I used context clues or looked up in dictionaries.  That was a tiring process, but it really boosted my Japanese vocabulary.  And I enjoyed great stories while doing so.

*Reading in another language: keep a dictionary in handy! It's a great way to learn new characters or to memorize new terms.*

## Shows (in my case, anime)

Listening to a conversation and deciphering what the person is saying is really a great way to practice what you know and to capture proper pronunciations.  Watching shows in different languages is quite difficult, but with persistence and guidance (e.g. subtitles, translation from friends), it can be a fun and meaningful process.  At times, you can also learn the culture of that country.  It's not 100% accurate at most times, but it's certainly a good method of learning the trends, slangs, etc.  I know a few of my friends who watch anime in different languages (dubs) to practice the language they're learning.

The image above is from <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso" target="_blank">四月は君の嘘</a> (Your Lie In April), an anime about musicians.  I highly recommend it.

*Watching shows in another language: ask a friend to translate or use subtitles at first.  After you're comfortable with the language or you want to test yourself, remove all aids and try your best.*

## Video Games and Music

	<figcaption>White Cat Project is currently the best way I'm retaining Japanese through pronunciations from voice actors and through the appearances of difficult Kanji characters and words.</figcaption>
</figure></center>

Video games, my all-time favorite form of pastime, actually helps me the most when it comes to retaining and learning the language.  I'm currently hooked on this Japanese mobile game called <a href="http://colopl.co.jp/shironekoproject/" target="_blank">白猫プロジェクト</a> (White Cat Project), created by COLOPL, Inc.  There is an English version of the game called <a href="http://runestorygame.com/" target="_blank">Colopl Rune Story</a>, if you're interested.  It's a game that has voice acting, so hearing pronunciations of unfamiliar words really help the aural portion of your learning.  There are difficult Kanji characters and terms all over this game, so this is currently the best form (and truly the best, because it's so much fun) of retaining my Japanese skills.

Songs are also a great way to aurally learn the language.  Just like hearing the pronunciations in voice actors, listening to singers for the meaning and depth of the song is not only a good lesson but also a great musical experience.  You might fall in love with a new band or singer in this process, and then tell all your friends about it!  Make them interested learn your language too.  By the way, my current favorite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKoD2CRr_KA" target="_blank">ゆず「表裏一体」</a> ("Hyori Ittai" by Yuzu).

*Listening in another language: decipher the meaning of what they're saying, piece by piece.  Songs are more challenging because they're paced differently, and the challenge could be made to your advantage.*

## Translation Tools

	<figcaption>There's no shame in using Google Translate to look up a word, even if it's your native language.</figcaption>
</figure></center>

Translation tools are handy and should be used whenever they're needed!  Google Translate is always my go-to page when I have a word I cannot translate.  There are many terms in Japanese that are difficult/impossible to translate to English (e.g. <a href="https://translate.google.com/?tl=es#ja/en/%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F%E3%81%A0%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99" target="_blank">いただきます</a> or <a href="https://translate.google.com/?tl=es#ja/en/%E3%81%8A%E7%96%B2%E3%82%8C%E3%81%95%E3%81%BE" target="_blank">お疲れさま</a>), and discussing about that is a fun process sometimes.  For example, Google Translate says いただきます (*itadakimasu*) means "Let's eat," but when *literally* translating the Japanese word, it means "I'll receive it" or similar.

*Translation tools are abundant on the web, so look for a great extension or website for the language you're learning.*

## Websites, Software, and Tools

	<figcaption>Using tools like rikaikun on unfamiliar Kanji help with the learning process.</figcaption>
</figure></center>

Some things are more difficult to learn, like medical and business terms.  For those, I'll probably have to really dive in and study them.  Websites like <a href="http://www.tanaka-clinic.net/eng/medical_terms.htm" target="_blank">Tanaka Clinic</a> and <a href="http://keizai-nihongo.com/eng/" target="_blank">Keizai-Nihongo</a> really help.  Also, I tend to find a lot of Kanji that I'm unfamiliar with or certain Kanji combinations that's difficult to decipher, so I use Google Chrome extensions like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en" target="_blank">rikaikun</a> to familiarize myself with new terms and characters.

*The internet is a treasure trove of resources when it comes to languages, so utilize it well!  There are great software out to help you as well, so keep searching.*

## "Self-Study": Slow But Steady

So, this form of "self-study" is kind of a magical process for me, albeit rather slow.  As stated before, it's not a process I would recommend if you wanted to quickly learn the language, but for retention and learning over time, I think it's great.  It will always be my preferred method.

What are some ways you use to retain your native language or to learn a new language?

<b>Color Me This!</b> is a color detection app for Android, created for a Mobile Computing class at UT Austin by Sydney Mercier, Andres Avila, and Kevin Rei Mateo.

## Features
* A camera preview screen with a clean overflow menu, a simple shutter button, and an upload-from-gallery feature.
* A full-screen immersive workspace with options to take another image or upload a different photo, and a status bar for color information and access to the Palette
* The ability to show or hide color names, hexadecimal values, and RGB values in the workspace status bar
* A Palette page, dedicated to save all of the user's favorite colors.
* The ability to copy the hexadecimal value of a color to the device's clipboard from the workspace or from the Palette.

## Future Considerations
* The ability to use both the front and back camera
* The ability to turn on / off / auto flash
* The ability to add filters to brighten / darken the photo
* More settings, such as turn off marquee

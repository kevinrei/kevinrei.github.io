<b>ChronoTrack</b> is an alarm application on Android used to keep track of times in video games, most notably mobile games.  Remind yourself to take a break to play, make sure your stamina is never wasted, or be the first to know when that long-awaited event starts.

## Features
* Add games you wish to keep track of, manually or by selecting an installed app.
* Select from three different types of alarms:
  * Stamina: Know when your stamina is full or when it reaches a certain point.
  * Date & Time: Set a specific date and time to get a reminder of a certain event.
  * Condition: Specify a time to count down from.
* Use a quick timer to instantly start keeping track of something.

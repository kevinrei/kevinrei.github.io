<b>The Nine Criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder</b> is a video project created for one of my favorite courses at UT Austin: <i>Contemporary Issues in Computer Science</i>.

## Description
Video game addiction is not an official mental disorder, but the APA proposed nine different criteria for the Internet Gaming Disorder in the DSM-5, Section 3.

The conditions for Internet Gaming Disorder: the individual must participate in the persistent and recurrent use of the Internet and be categorized under at least five of the nine criteria over a 12-month period.  

The severity of the addiction can vary: it can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the degree of disruption of normal activities.

Special thanks to my friends who helped me with this (listed in credits).

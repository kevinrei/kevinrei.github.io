## Features

### General: 
* Create profiles with name, birthday, and a list of interests to know what the wishers may love.
* Save gift ideas and their prices.  Add images, descriptions, and hyperlinks to remember them easily.
* Choose a category and occasion for your gift ideas to sort them easily.
* Know whose birthdays are upcoming to make sure you have that wish ready to grant.
* View all items at once to see what kind of gift ideas you have saved, including yours.
* Keep track of your purchase history to know what you bought and who you bought the gift for.
* Change the currency from the default USD to Euro, Pound, Yen, or Philippine Peso.
  
### Your very own wish list:
* Of course, the best wishes are not just for friends and families! Save all the best wishes you have by adding items to your own wish list.
* Share your wish list to let your friends and families know what your best wishes are!
  
### Budget tracking:
* Set an overall budget to always keep in mind how much you have left to spend on gifts all year round!
* Set a Christmas budget to keep track of your spending during the holiday season.
* Set a birthday budget to know how much you set aside for that special person's important day.
* Set one specific occasion to track in the miscellaneous tab!
  
### Data backup and wish list protection:
* Backup your database externally!  Save the file using a file manager like ES File Explorer to always have a backup just in case.
* Password protect your wish list application so that your gift ideas are always a surprise.

----------

## My wish list for future improvements:
* Visual upgrade
* Better compatibility in landscape mode
* Accommodations to larger screen sizes
* Log-in feature
* Amazon integration
* Cloud backup for databases and passwords

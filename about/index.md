<i>My passion lies in two types of programming: <b>computer programming</b> and <b>event programming</b>.</i>
</center>

I've been both a passionate leader and a loyal follower when it comes to doing the things I love: mainly, the two types of programming I'm into.  I have coded some cool ideas independently to fill my hunger for knowledge in the world of technology, and I have led groups and followed great leaders to program some of the best events during my university days.  I think I have a lot of randomness in me, having been tackling a lot of different areas and topics of interest especially in Computer Science, but I'd like to call it **versatility**.

My life right now contains a lot of self-learning.  I've been working on Android projects to boost my knowledge in Java and to build cool things.  I've been learning a lot on lynda.com (using my LinkedIn Premium trial, I admit) to revisit the basic&mdash;but essential&mdash;concepts like OOP and code efficiency.  I've been diving into new languages like Python and SQL to expand my arsenal of programming tools, and I've been using new tools like Eclipse and Unity 2D program more efficiently.

My life right now also contains a lot of mobile gaming (especially Puzzle & Dragons and White Cat Project), Game of Thrones, and taking care of our adorable rescue dog, Mocha.

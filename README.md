Welcome to my personal website, created for multiple purposes: to serve as a sort of casual resume, to practice web development, and to post blog entries and interesting things around me.

This website was created using the **[Moon](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)** theme: a minimal, one column jekyll theme created by GitHub user TaylanTatli.

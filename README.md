Welcome to my personal website!  It serves multiple purposes: to practice my web development, to let you know a little about myself, and to post some blog entries.

This website is created using the **[Moon](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)** template, a minimal, one column jekyll theme by GitHub user TaylanTatli.

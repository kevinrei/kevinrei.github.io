		<p><strong><em>Color Me This!</em></strong> is a simple camera app created to help users easily determine colors they are unsure about.  It mainly focuses on helping the color blind determine specific colors or making graphic designers' lives easier by providing them the information they need to get their favorite or needed colors.</p>

		<p>With Color Me This! you can take a photo or upload an image from your gallery and find the closest color associated to a selected pixel. You can check the name, hexadecimal value, and RGB values of that color.  You can also save your favorite colors in your Palette!</p>

		<p>Disclaimer: Depending on the lighting of a photo or your camera quality, the color values returned may not be exactly true-to-life.</p>
